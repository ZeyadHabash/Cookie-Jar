# Cookie-Jar
Project for CSEN 605 (Digital System Design) using VHDL and Arduino

Implemented a cookie jar that will detect if a user placed his hand
beneath the cookie jar and if there is enough cookie available in the cookie jar. If
there are enough cookies, he/she should enter the amount of cookies they want
through the keypad and if the amount is available the cookie jar should dispense
the number of cookies Requested and the reduced amount should be displayed on a
screen.
